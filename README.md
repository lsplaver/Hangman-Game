Psychic Game

## Purpose:
Psychic Game is a browser game where you need to guess the correct letter.

## Description:
In this project you are presented with a screen showing current letters guessed, total wins, total losses, and how many guesses remaining.  When you type a letter the game checks to see if it is matches the randomly generated secret letter which is generated at the beginning of each game.  You have ten guesses to try and figure out the secret letter.  Each guessed letter is displayed along with all previous ones for the current game.  If you correctly guess it the game ends and increments the total wins, otherwise if you run out of guesses it increments the total losses.  Either way, after updating the score a new game begins resetting the guessed letters, the remaining guesses and generating a new random letter.

## Tech Used:
To accomplish this, the app utilizes jQuery, JavaScript, BootStrap
